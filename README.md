## Build and run

### Development mode

1. Build the binary with `go build`
2. Run `./seashells-server`

### Production mode

1. Build the binary with `go build`
2. Configure some settings, by `cp env.sample env` and editing the resulting `env` file
3. Run with `./run.bash`

### Environment Variables

- `NETCAT_BINDING`: interface/port to listen for terminal connections.  
  Defaults to `:1337`. üìù This should be directly accessible to the network/internet.
- `WEBAPP_BINDING`: interface/port to listen for web app connections.  
  Defaults to `:8080`. üìù _Strongly_ consider using `127.0.0.1:port` and using a secure reverse proxy.
- `BASE_URL`: URL prefix to print out with randomized connection path string when terminal connections are established.  
  Defaults to `https://seashells.io/v/`. üìù You will almost certainly want to change this.  
- `GIN_MODE`: [Gin web framework](https://gin-gonic.com/) mode (`debug` or `release`).  
  Defaults to `debug`.
- `GTAG`: Header tag to pass along with requests.  
  Defaults to `g-tag`. # üö® CHANGE THIS!
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD`: Password to use for all admin actions.  
  Defaults to `xxx`. # üö® CHANGE THIS!

### Paths

- `/v/:id` the default endpoint provided after establishing a terminal session (full xterm.js terminal emulation)
- `/p/:id` plaintext version of ^^
- `/inspect` admin login endpoint to see an overview of sessions username is `admin` and password is in `ADMIN_PASSWORD` env var
